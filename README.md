# Seattle Conlang Club PidginCraft resource pack
The SCC PidginCraft resource pack provides an additional language in the languages menu called `Seattle Conlang Club PidginCraft pidgin (Seattle)`, which translates in-game text into the pidgin, except for the main menu and most of the settings menus.

## How to re-generate
To fetch and re-generate the resource pack as `scc_resourcepack.zip`, simply run `make_resourcepack.sh` and it will fetch the vocab list in Google Sheets and turn it into a resource pack.
